```

## Problem 1
a) Qualitative, ordinal
b) Qualitative, binary
c) Qualitative, ordinal
d) Quantitative, continuous
e) Quantitative, discrete

## Problem 2
``` {r scores, cache = T, echo = F}
depression_score <- c(45, 39, 25, 47, 49, 5, 70, 99, 74, 37, 99, 35, 8, 59)
```

a) Descriptive summaries of the depression scores for 14 individuals in a study
``` {r descriptive, cache = T}
mean_score <- mean(depression_score)
median_score <- median(depression_score)
range_score <- max(depression_score) - min(depression_score)
sd_score <- sd(depression_score)
```
Mean: `r round(mean_score, digits = 2)`  
Median: `r round(median_score, digits = 2)`  
Range: `r round(range_score, digits = 2)`  
SD: `r round(sd_score, digits = 2)`  

b)
